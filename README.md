# cyclone-composite
This repository contains code, data processing scripts, and documentation for generating cyclone-centered composites from reanalysis datasets (e.g., ERA5). It includes tools for identifying cyclone centers, extracting relevant meteorological fields, and interpolating the data onto a cyclone-relative coordinate system for composite analysis.
